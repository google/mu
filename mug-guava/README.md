# Using Mug with Guava

This artifact provides utilities with both Mug and Guava dependencies.

* `SafeQuery` builds SQL queries using the same template syntax as `StringFormat`, while preventing SQL injection.
* `GuavaCollectors` provide extra `Collector` and `BiCollector`s.
* `CaseBreaker` helps breaking apart camelCase, snake_case, UPPER_SNAKE_CASE and dash-case words.
* `BinarySearch` is a generic binary search algorithm that can be used for use cases beyond `List` and arrays.
* `Immutables` has more convenient factory methods for Guava immutable collections.
