 * Logically, a {@code BiCollector} collects "pairs of things", just as a {@link Collector} collects

 * input pairs to a {@code ConcurrentMap}:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * ConcurrentMap<String, Integer> map = BiStream.of("a", 1).collect(Collectors::toConcurrentMap);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>In addition to the common implementations provided by {@link BiCollectors},
 * many {@code Collector}-returning factory methods can be directly "method referenced" as {@code
 * BiCollector} if the method accepts two {@code Function} parameters corresponding to "key" and
 * "value" respectively. For example: {@code Collectors::toConcurrentMap}, {@code
 * ImmutableSetMultimap::toImmutableSetMultimap}, {@code Maps::toImmutableEnumMap} and {@code
 * ImmutableBiMap::toImmutableBiMap} etc.
